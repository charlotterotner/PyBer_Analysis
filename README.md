# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to understand how Pyber fares, rides, and drivers differed by city type for the months of January through April.

## Results: 
After running the code we were able to create the following DataFrame with Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and  visual showing the total fares by city type:

From this DataFrame we can see that Urban cities have the greatest number of rides, drivers, and total fares even though they have the lowest average fare per ride. 

On the flipside, Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride but still perform poorly when looking at total fares since they have a low number of rides and drivers.

We could also see this data over time in a visual manner with the line graph below:

As we can see, Urban cities is performing best, followed by Suburban cities, and then Rural cities showing the lowest total fare amount. 

## Summary

Based on these results I'd like to provide the following three business recommendations to the CEO.

We can see that the greatest opportunity for improvement for Pyber is for rides in rural cities. We could increase the number of drivers in rural areas. This will increase the overall fare amount without increasing fares, which are already high for this area. We could do this by increasing marketing efforts around adding drivers.

On the flipside, we could also look into decreasing fares in rural areas. People may be less inclined to order Pyber in rural areas because of the high fare costs. There is a chance we could increase rides by decreasing fares slightly, and result in overall greater amount of rides and higher sum of fares.

If Pyber wants to focus on overall profit, and doesn't want to focus on a specific city, I'd recommend to increase the fare per ride in Urban cities. The average fair is the lowest out of all 3 city types but there is plenty of demand showing the greatest amount of drivers and rides. If we increase fares even a small amount we could see increased fares and profit without too much risk of losing riders which is already high.
